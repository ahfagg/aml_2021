  <LI> This work is to be done on your own.  While general discussion
       about Python, Keras and Tensorflow is encouraged, sharing
       solution-specific code is inappropriate.  Likewise, downloading
       solution-specific code is not allowed.

<H2>The Problem</H2>

Peptides are short chains of amino acids that perform a wide range of
biological functions, depending on the specific sequence of amino
acids.  Understanding how amino acids interact with other molecules is
key to understanding the mechanisms of genetic diseases and to
constructing therapies to address these diseases.

<P>

One form of interaction is the question of how well a peptide binds to
a specific molecule (this is known as <EM>binding affinity</EM>).  For
this assignment, we will use a data set that includes a measure of
binding affinity for a large number of peptides toward two molecules,
known as HLA-DRB1*13:01 and HLA-DRB1*15:01.  Our goal is to predict
the binding affinity for novel peptides toward these molecules.  

<P>

<H3>Amino Acids</H3>

A total of 22 amino acids make up the building blocks for all peptides
and proteins.  The following table gives the names and one-letter
codes used to represent these amino acids:
<P>

<P>

<H3>Data Set</H3>

The <A
HREF="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/suppl/immunology/NetMHCIIpan-3.2/">data
set</A> is available in the git repository in a set of CSV 
files.  The data are already partitioned into five independent folds
of training and validation data.  For the purposes of this assignment,
you should preserve this partition.  Also, you should only use the
HLA-DRB1*15:01 molecule (look for files containing "1501").

<P>
Each row in the CSV files contains two columns: a string representing
the sequence of amino acids and a measure of binding affinity.  Here
is an example:
<P>

<PRE>
DLDKKETVWHLEE,0
DKSKPKVYQWFDL,0
HYTVDKSKPKVYQ,0
KSKPKVYQWFDLR,0
LHYTVDKSKPKVY,0
TVDKSKPKVYQWF,0
VDKSKPKVYQWFD,0
YTVDKSKPKVYQW,0
ADVILPIGTRSVETD,0.646144
AFKPVLVDEGRKVAI,0.57075
AGLKTNDRKWCFEGP,0.615622
AHLAEENEGDNACKR,0
ALYEKKLALYLLLAL,0.610019
ANGKTLGEVWKRELN,0.495407
</PRE>
<P>

Note that different rows contain different numbers of amino acids.

<P>

The binding affinity is encoded on a log scale and ranges between 0
and 1.  Peptides with affinities at or above 0.426 are considered
more likely than not to bind to the molecule in question, whereas
affinities below this threshold are considered less likely to bind.

<H2>Deep Learning Experiment</H2>

Objective: Create a recurrent neural network that predicts binding
affinity as a function of the amino acid string.

<UL>
  <LI> You will need to load the CSV files and create the
       tensorflow-compatible data sets.  I suggest that you:
       <UL>
	 <LI> Use a character-based encoding layer for the strings
	      (this is effectively a 1-hot encoding for each of the
	      characters in the string without the overhead of so many
	      zeros; see the RNN text preprocessing section in the
	      book)
	 <LI> "Zero-pad" the strings that are short with a special
	      character

       </UL>
<P>
  <LI> Follow the encoding layer with one or more trainable embedding
       layer(s).
       <P>
  <LI> Use your favorite RNN module
       <P>
  <LI> Use return_sequences=False
       <P>
  <LI> Use one or more dense layers to predict the affinity measure.
       Think about what the appropriate non-linearity is for the
       output unit
       <P>
       
</UL>

<H3>Performance Reporting</H3>

Once you have selected a reasonable architecture and set of
hyper-parameters, produce the following figures:

<OL>
  <LI> AUC as a function of epoch for each of the training folds (so,
       5 curves)
       <P>

  <LI> AUC as a function of epoch for each of the validation folds
       <P>

  <LI> Accuracy as a function of epoch for each of the training
       folds.  Note: using tf.keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy() as a
       metric will allow you to set the threshold of 0.426
       <P>

  <LI> Accuracy as a function of epoch for each of the validation folds
       <P>

</OL>

In addition, report the following:
<UL>
  <LI> Report the final, average AUC for both the training and
       validation sets.  An average validation AUC of 0.8 is doing
       well
       <P>

  <LI> Report the final, average accuracy for both the training and
       validation sets.  An average validation accuracy of 0.84 is
       doing well
</UL>

<H2>What to Hand In</H2>

Hand in a PDF file that contains:

<UL>
  <LI> Code for generating and training the network.  Some useful UNIX
       command line programs:
       <UL>
	 <LI> <B>enscript:</B> translate code (e.g., py files) into postscript files
	 <LI> <B>ps2pdf:</B>  translate postscript files into pdf files
	 <LI> <B>pdfunite:</B> merge several pdf files together
       </UL>
       <P>
  <LI> The above figures

       <P>
       
  <LI> The final metrics (note that this can be with respect to the
       best performing epoch, as identified by EarlyStopping)

       <P>



</UL>



<H2>Grades</H2>

<UL>
  <LI> 50 pts: Model generation code.  Is it correct?  clean? documented?
       <P>
       
  <LI> 50 pts: Model figures and performance.  
      <P>
       
  <LI> 10 pts: An average validation AUC of 0.82 or better
       <P>
